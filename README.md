# Sorting-Algorithms-Analysis-

Programmed six sorting algorithms in Eclipse IDE. 
Algorithms included the Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Selection Sort and QuickSort. 
Wrote detailed explanation about sorting algorithms, found their running time and effectiveness in certain situations.
Situations included Arrays varying in size and ordered from high to low, low to high and randomly distributed
Used System.nanoTime() to keep track of run time of individual sort.
